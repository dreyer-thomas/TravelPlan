This is nice and I want to extend it a bit. We know from the day item before the end time. We also know the duration of the travel segement. So we can draw such a time-tag as we have already in day items and accomodations also to the travel segement. Use the end time of the previous day item (or the checkout time of the accomodation) and show as end time the sum of this start time and the duration. This helps a lot to improve the planning.","CH","The intention was to create a story out of it. This would be better since it is documented then and test and validation would be done.
